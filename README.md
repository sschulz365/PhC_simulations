# PhC_simulations
A repository that contains free PhC simulation software.

Currently the software contains a MIT Photonics Band control (MPB) file authored by Daryl Beggs and Sebastian Schulz.
This file allows the simulation of W1 based photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides with both loss and dispersion engineering. The possible outputs include the group index distribution, the bandstructure, electric and magnetic field profiles, as well as the propagation loss. Also included are linux shell and Matlab scripts for the analysis of the simulation results.

For more information, including thecitation information nplease read the Documentation.pdf file included in 3D_PhC_waveguides.zip

Further scrpts will follow shortly.
