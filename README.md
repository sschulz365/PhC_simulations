# PhC_simulations
A repository that contains free PhC simulation software.

The branch 3D-simulations contains a MIT Photonics Band control (MPB) file authored by Daryl Beggs and Sebastian Schulz.
This file allows the simulation of W1 based photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides with both loss and dispersion engineering. The possible outputs include the group index distribution, the bandstructure, electric and magnetic field profiles, as well as the propagation loss. Also included are linux shell and Matlab scripts for the analysis of the simulation results.
For more information, including the citation information please read the Documentation.pdf file included in 3D_PhC_waveguides.zip

The branch 2D-simulation contains a version ofb the above script that performs 2D simlations of the same structures. While not as accurate as the 3D simulations, the 2D simulations are significantly less computationally intensive, requiring around 100 times less memory and simulation time. Once again more information, including relevant citations and background, can be found in the Documentation_2D.pdf file, which is also included in the 2D_PhC-waveguides.zip archive.
